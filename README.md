# Fitness Tracker

## What is this?
This is a web-based fitness tracker intended to help users record and analyze their workouts. This app will allow users to log various details about their workouts, including activity type, duration, perceived difficulty/performance, and additional comments. 
As the app is developed, I plan to add deep insights into users' progress over time, helping them track their performance and fitness improvements in a meaningful way.


## Features
**Activity Logging**: Record activity type, duration, perceived difficulty and perceived performance
**Comments**: Add specific details about your workouts, such as location, gear used, sets/reps, etc
**Progress Tracking**: Future updates will include insights into fitness progress over time, measuring performance and difficulty against metrics like duration, distance, sets/reps, max lifts, etc.


## Technologies Used:
**Frontend**: React
**Backend**: Python, Django
**Database**: SQLite

## Installation:
To run the development version of the fitness tracker, simply:
- Download the source code
- Navigate to the root project directory in a terminal
